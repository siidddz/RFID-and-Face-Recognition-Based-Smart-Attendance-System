# RFID-and-Face-Recognition-Based-Smart-Attendance-System

Description: This project is aimed at creating an RFID-based attendance system using NodeMCU, a development board based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The system allows for the automated recording of attendance by swiping RFID cards or tags, eliminating the need for manual entry and paper registers.

# Features:

•	Secure login system for administrators.
•	Admin panel for user management, device management, and viewing attendance logs.
•	User management system for enrolling, updating, and removing users.
•	Device management system for adding, updating, and removing RFID scanners.
•	View attendance logs with filtering options and export to Excel functionality.
•	Real-time attendance tracking and reporting.

# Hardware Components Required:

1.	NodeMCU ESP8266 development board
2.	RFID-RC522 module
3.	Jumper wires (Male to Male)
4.	Breadboard (Solderless)
   
# Software Required:

1.	Arduino IDE
2.	XAMPP server (or any web server with PHP and MySQL support)
3.	RFID-RC522 Library
4.	NodeMCU ESP8266 Library and Board Manager
	
# Setup Instructions:

1.	Install Arduino IDE and XAMPP server on your computer.
2.	Download and install the necessary libraries for Arduino IDE.
3.	Connect the RFID-RC522 module to the NodeMCU ESP8266 development board as per the provided pinouts.
4.	Configure the Wi-Fi settings and server URL in the Arduino sketch.
5.	Deploy the PHP web app on your server and set up the MySQL database.
6.	Import the provided SQL file to create the required database tables.
7.	Access the admin panel via the provided URL and login using the default credentials.
8.	Start using the RFID-based attendance system to manage attendance efficiently.
